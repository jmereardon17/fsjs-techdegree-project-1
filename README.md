# FSJS Techdegree Project 1

For this project I had to create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. I had to select my own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc and create an array of objects that holds data about the quotes, such as citation and source. I had to randomly display a quote by selecting a random object and dynamically insert it's content into HTML to display it onto the page.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

- Add an additional quote object property and use that property as extra content on the page.
- Create a function that updates the background color to a random color.
- Create a timing function with the setInterval() method to print a new quote to the page at regular intervals (set to every 10 seconds).

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
